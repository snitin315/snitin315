# üëãüèª  Hi, I'm Nitin!

### __I am a software developer and an open-source maintainer based in India.__ 

![header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46647141/125195310-bd006180-e272-11eb-81fb-66a8cefb14a2.jpg)

 ### __I am currently helping in the development and maintenance of [__ESLint__](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and the [__webpack__](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) ecosystem.__

Maintaining such a big project does not only mean coding, I spend a considerable amount of my online time helping the webpack and the ESLint community and ensuring that everyone finds a welcoming environment.

My aim is to make it easy for everyone to start contributing to webpack and ESLint, and for the existing contributors to feel like valuable members of the community.

As part of my daily open-source work, I usually work on the development of: 

- [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) 
- [webpack-cli](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli) 
- [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
- [official documentation on webpack.js.org](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org)
- [official loaders and plugins for webpack](https://github.com/webpack-contrib)
- [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)


I occasionally contribute to some other open-source projects as well:

- [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- [opencollective](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective)
- [open-event](https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend)


If you are looking for profiles to sponsor, I would love your appreciation. My goal with sponsorship is to be able to work full-time on OSS that is essential to the web continuing to thrive.

### You can support my open-source work via:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/snitin315)
- [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/snitin315)


I'll try to do my best with OSS.

Thanks for taking the time to read this :hearts:
